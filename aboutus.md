<h2>Our Humble Beginnings</h2>
Sim Hup Seng has a long history, stretching back to the 1980s. From generation to generation, this business and the service philosophy was passed down through the family line. 

Sim Hup Seng Services has gone through overwhelming change and growth since its humble origins. Thomas, the current owner of the business, has repeatedly re-designed the Portable Toilets into the present day <b>fiber-glass manhole toilets with a range of premium facilities</b> to meet your needs. From a one man show, our business has grown steadily over the last decades.

Once again, we have no one but you, our customers to thank for your continued support over the years. 

<b>Thank you! </b>

                    The high raised steps leading up to the toilet, the squatting-style toilet bowl and the often times slippery flooring posed serious problems for elderly toilet users.

                  Thomas worked hard re-designing a new fleet of portable toilets. These toilets will have no raised steps, sitting-style ceramic bowls, elderly handrails and anti-slip flooring. With bated breath, the toilet was launched to market.

                    The new fleet of "elderly-friendly" toilets was a breakthrough in the industry and were extremely well-received by new and long-time customers alike.
