message: "The set up of the portable toilet at the funeral wake blk 213 Lorong 8 Toa Payoh MPH (30 Jan 2025 to 02 Feb 2025) has made my guests change their opinion about wet dirty smelly portable funeral wake toilets of the old days. \r\nThey were impressed ! \r\nHowever, if a small shelf can be included to put small items e.g. handphone will further enhance the usage experience."
