message: "We have engaged SHS Services in Oct 2021. It was during Covid-19 period with multiple restrictions. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Thomas and his team for the excellent service as well as being very accommodating and understanding during our struggling times. They made sure that all our requests were answered and it was basically a one stop service for everything. The mobile toilet delivered was bright and clean at all times. Thank you once again for the responsive and excellent service! \U0001F44D\U0001F44D"
