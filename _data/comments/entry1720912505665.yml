message: SHS left a huge impression on me when they provided portable toilets for a funeral event I attended when a distant relative passed away. The elderly friendly facilities really makes a difference and many elder people were all commenting about it. That said, they hardly use social media so I just wanted to leave a thank you note here as a sign of appreciation. The toilets were extremely clean which took me by surprise based on past experiences I had with other companies. Thank you!
