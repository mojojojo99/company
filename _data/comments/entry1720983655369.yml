message: 'We engaged the services of SHS Group Pte Ltd in Aug 2017. It was a difficult time for us and I cannot express how grateful we are for their services. The toilets delivered came with shower facilities which was unhead of at that time. It was clean, no chemical smell during flushing and bright. 
The team displayed immense compassion, professionalism and attention to details. The fridge is duly stocked up twice daily and the nuts and melon seeds are in constant supply. 
I highly recommend SHS Group Pte Ltd. They took care of all our needs leaving us with time to grieve and say godbye to our loved ones. Thank you for your kindness and dedication.'
