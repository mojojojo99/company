message: "We hired SHS for our funeral event in 2018, and we couldn't be more pleased with the service. From start to finish, they were professional, efficient, and accommodating. Most important of all - No hidden cost.\r\nThe portable toilets were exceptionally clean and well-maintained, making sure our guests had a comfortable experience throughout the event. They provided enough units to cover our large crowd, and each one was fully stocked with hand sanitizers, toilet papers and other essentials. The units were also delivered and set up on time, which made event preparation much smoother.\r\nThe tentage and fridge services were equally impressive. The tents were sturdy and the chiller fridges were well-designed. They were installed quickly and efficiently, and the team was very flexible in adjusting the layout to suit our venue's needs.\r\nOverall, we are extremely satisfied with the quality of service and the attention to detail. If you're looking for reliable and high-quality portable toilet and funeral services, I highly recommend Mr Thomas - SHS."
