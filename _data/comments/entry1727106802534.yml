  I have engaged SHS Services for my grandmother-in-law in 2021. Would like to
  thank the team for the responsive services as well as being very understanding
  and accommodating to our needs. The portable toilets were very modern and
  clean with no harsh chemical smell. Just want to say a big thank you to Thomas
  and his team.
